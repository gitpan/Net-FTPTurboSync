Net-FTPTurboSync version 0.07
=============================

turbo-ftp-sync - a script moves changes of files and folders of a local
machine to a remote one via FTP very fast with minimum network traffic.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

turbo-ftp-sync [ options ] [ <localdir> <remoteURL> ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The script synchronizes files and folder on an FTP server with local ones via
usual FTP protocol. The advantage of this script over usual FTP client is it
doesn't upload all data every time but only once. 

Its secret is that it doesn't ask a FTP server about last modification date and
current size of each file. These information is stored in local SQLite db.
Therefore this program doesn't explore folder tree of a remote host. It acts
blindly. You can interrupt a process of this program in any time and you will
not lose changes which you already uploaded.

The program can move changes only one direction from a local machine to remote
one. If a file was changed on a remote machine and a local one then the program
overwrite the remove version of the file by the local one.

turbo-ftp-sync.pl is based on sources of ftpsync.pl program.
Christoph Lechleitner is the initial author of ftpsync.pl (ftpsync@ibcl.at)
